abstract="Suppose we are given a proof of knowledge {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}in which a prover demonstrates that he knows a solution to a given problem instance. Suppose also that we have a secret sharing scheme {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}on n participants. Then under certain assumptions on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}, we show how to transform {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}into a witness indistinguishable protocol, in which the prover demonstrates knowledge of the solution to some subset of n problem instances out of a collection of subsets defined by {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}}{\$}{\$}. For example, using a threshold scheme, the prover can show that he knows at least d out of n solutions without revealing which d instances are involved. If the instances are independently generated, we get a witness hiding protocol, even if {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}did not have this property. Our results can be used to efficiently implement general forms of group oriented identification and signatures. Our transformation produces a protocol with the same number of rounds as {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}and communication complexity n times that of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}P{\}}{\$}{\$}. Our results use no unproven complexity assumptions.",
